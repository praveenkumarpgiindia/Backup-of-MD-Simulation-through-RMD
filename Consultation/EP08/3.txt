The session took place in a small booth on the fifth floor of the Acoustik Studio. 
Three songs were recorded that day: "Fever," "Summertime," and "September Song." 
This session was to be the first time John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever played 
music together.

One wonders what went through the minds of John, Paul, George and Ringo on that 
historic day. Did the four hit it off? Did they feel a natural kinship? A 
rapport? Did any of the three have any sort of premonition about their collective future?

The session ended and the three Beatles and Ringo went their separate ways. 
But on several occasions over the next year and a half, when Pete Best was ill, 
indisposed, or otherwise unavailable, Ringo would climb aboard his drum kit and 
sit in for him.
