When you have gzipped files, you also have the powerful Z commands to work on them.

These Z commands provide a ‘Z’ equivalent of the regular file manipulation commands.

So, you get

* ***** for cat to view compressed file
* ***** for grep to search inside the compressed file
* ***** for less, zmore for more, to view the file in pages
* ***** for diff to see the difference between two compressed files
