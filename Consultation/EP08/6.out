Tom said to himself that it was not such a
hollow world, after all. He had
discovered a great law of human action,
without knowing itâ€”namely, that in order
to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it
is only necessary to make the thing
difficult to attain. If he had been a
great and wise philosopher, like the
writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of
whatever a body is obliged to do, and that
Play consists of whatever a body is not
obliged to do. And this would help him to
understand why constructing artificial
flowers or performing on a tread-mill is
work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
Mont Blanc is only amusement.  There are
wealthy gentlemen in England who drive
four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or
thirty miles on a daily line, in the
summer, because the privilege costs them
considerable money; but if they were
offered wages for the service, that would
turn it into work and then they would
resign.
