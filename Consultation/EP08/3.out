The session took place in a small booth on the fifth floor of the Acoustik Studio. 
Three songs were recorded that day: "Fever," "Summertime," and "September Song." 
This session was to be the first time <em>John</em>, <em>Paul</em>, <em>George</em>, and <em>Ringo</em> ever played 
music together.

<p>
One wonders what went through the minds of <em>John</em>, <em>Paul</em>, <em>George</em> and <em>Ringo</em> on that 
historic day. Did the four hit it off? Did they feel a natural kinship? A 
rapport? Did any of the three have any sort of premonition about their collective future?
</p>
<p>
The session ended and the three Beatles and <em>Ringo</em> went their separate ways. 
But on several occasions over the next year and a half, when Pete Best was ill, 
indisposed, or otherwise unavailable, <em>Ringo</em> would climb aboard his drum kit and 
sit in for him.
